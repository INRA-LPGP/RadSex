Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A C++11 compliant compiler (GCC >= 4.8.1, Clang >= 3.3)
* The zlib library (which should be installed on linux by default)

.. _install-release:

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

RADSex can be installed from one of the release packages [TODO: link], or the latest stable development version can be installed directly from the GitHub repository.

**1. Install the latest release**

RADSex is currently in beta and there is no available release yet. This section will be updated with the release of RADSex 1.0.

**2. Install from GitHub**

To install the latest stable version of RADSex from the GitHub repository, run the following commands:

::

    git clone https://github.com/RomainFeron/RadSex.git
    cd RadSex
    make

The compiled **radsex** binary will be located in **RadSex/bin/**.


Update RADSex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update RADSex, you can download the latest stable release and install it as described in the :ref:`install-release` section.

If you installed RADSex from Github, run the following commands from the RadSex directory:

::

    git pull
    make rebuild


Before starting
---------------

Before running the pipeline, you should prepare the following elements:

* A **set of demultiplexed reads**. The current version of RADSex does not implement demultiplexing. Raw sequencing reads can be demultiplexed using `Stacks <http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/comp/process_radtags.php>`_ or `pyRAD <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/dereneaton/af9548ea0e94bff99aa0/pyRAD_v.3.0.ipynb#The-seven-steps-described>`_.
* A **population map**: a tabulated file with individual ID as the first column and sex as the second column. It is important that the individual IDs in the popmap are the same as the names of the demultiplexed reads files (see the [popmap section](#population-map) for details).
* If you want to map the sequences to a reference genome: a **reference genome** in fasta format.

.. note:: When visualizing `map` results with `radsex-vis`, linkage groups / chromosomes are automatically inferred from scaffold names in the reference sequence if their name starts with *LG*, *CHR*, or *NC* (case unsensitive). If chromosomes are named differently in the reference genome, you should prepare a tabulated file with reference scaffold ID in the first column and corresponding chromosome name in the second column (see the [chromosomes names section](#chromosomes-names) for details).


Running RADSex
--------------

.. _computing-cov-table:

Computing the markers table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of RADSex is to create a table of marker depth for the dataset using the ``process`` command:

::

    radsex process --input-dir ./samples --output-file markers_table.tsv --threads 16 --min-depth 1

In this example, demultiplexed reads are stored in **./samples** and the markers table generated by ``process`` will be stored in **markers_table.tsv**. The parameter ``--threads`` specifies the number of threads to use, and ``--min-depth`` specifies the minimum depth to consider a marker present in an individual: markers which are not present with depth higher than this value in at least one individual will not be retained in the markers table.
It is advised to keep the minimum depth to 1 for this step, as it can be adjusted for each analysis later.

The resulting file **markers_table.tsv** is a table with N + 2 columns, where *N* is the number of individuals in the dataset :

* **ID** : marker ID.
* **Sequence** : marker sequence.
* For each individual, the depth of this marker.


Computing the distribution of markers between sexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After generating the markers table, the ``distrib`` command is used to compute the distribution of markers between sexes:

::

    radsex distrib --markers-table markers_table.tsv --output-file distribution.tsv --popmap popmap.tsv --min-depth 5``

In this example, the value of ``--markers-table`` is the table generated in the :ref:`computing-cov-table` section, and the distribution of markers between sexes will be stored in **distribution.tsv**.
The sex of each individual in the population is given by **popmap.tsv** (see the [popmap section](#population-map) for details).
The minimum depth to consider a marker present in an individual is set to 5, meaning that markers with depth lower than 5 in an individual will not be considered present in this individual.

The resulting file **distribution.tsv** is a table with five columns:

* **Males** : number of males in which a marker was present.
* **Females** : number of females in which a marker was present.
* **Markers** : number of markers present in the corresponding number of males and females.
* **P** : p-value of a chi-squared test for association with sex.
* **Signif** : significant association with sex (True / False).

More details about the distribution file can be found in the [TODO SECTION].

This distribution can be visualized with the ``plot_sex_distribution()`` function of `RADSex-vis <https://github.com/RomainFeron/RADSex-vis>`_, which generates a heatmap of markers with males on the x-axis and females on the y-axis.


Extracting markers significantly associated with sex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markers significantly associated with sex can be obtained with the ``signif`` command:

::

    radsex signif --markers-table markers_table.tsv --output-file markers.tsv --popmap popmap.tsv --min-depth 5 [ --output-format fasta ]

In this example, the value of ``--markers-table`` is the table generated in the :ref:`computing-cov-table` section, and the markers significantly associated with sex are output in **markers.tsv**. The sex of each individual in the population is given by **popmap.tsv** (see the [popmap section](#population-map) for details), and the minimum depth to consider a marker present in an individual is set to 5, meaning that markers with depth lower than 5 in an individual will not be considered present in this individual.

By default, the ``signif`` function generates an output file in the same format as the markers table. However, the sequences can be exported to fasta using the ``--output-fasta`` parameter (see TODO SECTION).

The markers table generated by ``signif`` can be visualized with the ``plot_coverage()`` function of `RADSex-vis <https://github.com/RomainFeron/RADSex-vis>`_, which generates a heatmap showing the depth of each marker in each individual.


Mapping markers to a reference genome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markers can be aligned to a reference genome using the ``map`` command:

::

    radsex map --input-file markers_table.tsv --output-file mapping.tsv --popmap popmap.tsv --genome-file genome.fasta --min-quality 20 --min-frequency 0.1 --min-depth 5

In this example, the input file ``--input-file`` is the coverage table generated in the :ref:`computing-cov-table` step, the mapping results will be stored in **sequences.tsv**, and the path to the reference genome file is given by ``--genome-file``. The sex of each individual in the population is given by **popmap.tsv** (see the [popmap section](#population-map) for details), and the minimum coverage to consider a marker present in an individual is set to 5, meaning that markers with coverage lower than 5 in an individual will not be considered present in this individual. The parameter ``--min-quality`` specifies the minimum mapping quality (as defined in `BWA <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml>`_) to consider a marker properly mapped, and is set to 20 in this example. The parameter ``--min-frequency`` specifies the minimum frequency of a marker in at least one sex; it is set to 0.1 here, meaning that only sequences present in at least 10% of individuals of one sex are retained for mapping.

The resulting file ``mapping.tsv`` is a table with five columns:

* **Sequence :** ID of the mapped sequence.
* **Contig :** ID of the contig where the sequence mapped.
* **Position :** position of the mapped sequence on the contig.
* **SexBias :** sex-bias of the mapped sequence, defined as (Males / Total males ) - (Females / Total females), where *Males* and *Females* are the number of males and number of females in which the sequence is present, respectively, and *Total males* and *Total females* are the total number of males and females in the population, respectively.
* **P :** p-value of a chi-squared test for association with sex.
* **Signif** : significant association with sex (True / False).

The mapping results generated by ``map`` can be visualized with the ``plot_genome()`` function of `RADSex-vis <https://github.com/RomainFeron/RADSex-vis>`_, which generates a circular plot with the sex-bias and association with sex of each marker mapped on the genome.
Mapping results for a specific contig can be visualized with the ``plot_scaffold()`` function to show the same metrics for a single contig.
