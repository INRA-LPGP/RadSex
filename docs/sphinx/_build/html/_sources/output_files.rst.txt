Markers depth table
-------------------

Coverage tables are tabulated files with header generated by the ``process`` command for the entire dataset, and by the ``subset`` and ``signif`` commands for a subset of sequences. The first column contains the marker ID, and the second column contains the sequence itself. Each other column contains the coverage of the corresponding marker in a given individual.
An example of coverage table is given below (sequences were shortened for practical reasons):

::

	ID    Sequence    individual_1    individual_2    individual_3    individual_4    individual_5
	 0   TGCA..TATT              0              15              24              17              21
	 1   TGCA..GACC             20              18               3              26               4
	 2   TGCA..ATCG              2               1               5              16               0

.. _sex-distribution-file:

Distribution of markers between groups
--------------------------------------

**Table format**

A table of distribution of markers between sexes is a tabulated file with header generated by the ``distrib`` command.
The first and second columns indicate the number of males and females in which a marker is present, the third column contains the number of markers found in the corresponding number of males and females, the fourth column contains the p-value of a chi-squared test for association with sex on the number of males and females, and the fifth column indicates whether this p-value is significant after Bonferroni correction.

An example of sex distribution table is given below for 3 males and 3 females:

::

	Males    Females    Sequences       P     Signif
	    0          1            7       1     False
	    0          2            3    0.39     False
	    0          3            1    0.10     False
	    1          0            6       1     False
	    1          1            5       1     False
	    1          2            1       1     False
	    1          3            2    0.39     False
	    2          0            3    0.39     False
	    2          1            8       1     False
	    2          2            4       1     False
	    2          3            2       1     False
	    3          0            4    0.10     False
	    3          1            7    0.39     False
	    3          2            6       1     False
	    3          3            9       1     False


In this example, there are 68 sequences in total, therefore sequences are significantly associated with sex if the p-value of a chi-squared test on the number of males and females is lower than 0.05 / 68 = 0.00074 (Bonferroni correction).

**Matrix format**

The distribution of sequences between sexes can also be output as a matrix, which is a tabulated file without header, with number of females as rows and number of males as rows.
The sex distribution matrix for the example described above is given below:

::

	0    6    3    4
	7    5    8    7
	3    1    4    6
	1    2    2    9


.. _fasta-file:

Fasta files
-----------

FASTA files are be generated by the ``subset`` and ``signif`` commands for a subset of sequences, if the ``--output-format`` parameter is set to *fasta*.

In the ``subset`` analysis, FASTA headers are generated with the following pattern:

``<ID>_<number of males>M_<number of females>F_cov:<minimum coverage>``

In the ``signif`` analysis, another field containing the p-value of association with sex is added:

``<ID>_<number of males>M_<number of females>F_cov:<minimum coverage>_p:<p-value>``


.. _mapping-results-file:

Alignment results
-----------------

Results from the ``map`` command are output as a tabulated file with header.
The first column contains the sequence ID, the second column contains the contig to which the sequence mapped in the reference genome, and the third columns contains the position where the sequence mapped on the contig.
The fourth column contains a sex-bias value, defined as `(number of males with the sequence) / (total number of males) - (number of females with the sequence) / (total number of females)`.
The fifth column contains the p-value of a chi-squared test for association with sex, and the sixth column indicates whether this p-value is significant after Bonferroni correction.
An example of mapping results is given below:
